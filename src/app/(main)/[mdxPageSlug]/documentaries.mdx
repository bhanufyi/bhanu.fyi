## Finding Vivian Maier

## Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father

The [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5x2r6b/reddit_what_are_some_must_see_documentaries) that I used in order to discover almost all of the entries here strongly advised that I go into this one bare naked: no trailers, no spoilers; and this one really takes the cake

## Tickled

## Citizen Four

## Dealt

## Exit Through the Gift Shop

## Loving Vincent

## Winter on Fire

## Inside Job

I usually watch most things only once, and yet this one is an exception; a truly brilliant documentary going into the depth of the cause of the global financial meltdown on Fall 2008

## Planet Earth

An impeccable documentary with camera work which was simply ahead of its time, this one only gets better because of the legendary David Attenborough's narration

## Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief

Interviews with former members of the Church of Scientology which reveal abuses and what-can-be-summarized-as "strange" practices within the organization
