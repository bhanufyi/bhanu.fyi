I have been _greatly_ influenced by a bunch of beautiful people while working on this website. I'm not a very creative person myself, so a lot of things that you see here are a direct/indirect result of their work and efforts â€” show them some love!

## Inspiration

- [Kent C Dodds](https://kcd.com) for his epic react course.
- [Josh W Comeau](https://joshwcomeau.com) has been, by far, the biggest inspiration for this website.
